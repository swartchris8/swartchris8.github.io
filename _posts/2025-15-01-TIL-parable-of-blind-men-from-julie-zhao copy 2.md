5 blind men see an elephant and they each perceive the elephant as:
1. as a thin rope
2. wide leather
3. tough bark
4. etc

All of them perceive the true nature of a part of the elephant. To build the concept of a whole elephant you will need to combine the shards of truth.

In building a software product the different departments will see diffferent angle:
1. sales - revenue
2. product - KPIs / OKRs
3. engineering - code
4. enablement - customer success 

To align successfully across the departments have empathy for their success and come to problems from their perspective. This will help collaborate more effectively.
