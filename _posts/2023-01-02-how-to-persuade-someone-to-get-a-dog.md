A friend of mine has very creative daughters they shared the benefits of getting a dog on multiple channels:

1. Hid a note in a sandwich
2. Highlighted on toilet paper
3. Constantly bringing it up in conversation

In the end the family decided to get a dog. My wife is also not such a dog person but I am not sure if sheâ€™d appreciate a note in a sandwich.

Was it creative messaging, persistence, or psychological warfare?
