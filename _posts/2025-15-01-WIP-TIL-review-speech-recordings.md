After 3 days of speech review the speech in 3 ways:

1. VISUALS - How is my posture? Do I look happy?
2. TURN UP THE VOLUME - Does the content add value? Do I sound confident? Is there tonality?
3. INCONSISTENCIES - Any inconsistencies between sound and visuals?

Sight / Sound / Sync work on all of it like a gym
