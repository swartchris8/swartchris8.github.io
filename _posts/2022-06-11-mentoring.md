As we are moving ahead with our PLG motion I have found it very important to reach out to external mentors and peers to fill in gaps in my analytics and management knowledge. 


There are 2 resources I would really recommend for reaching out to mentors who can help in a wide range of topics:
[Mentoring Club](https://www.mentoring-club.com/the-mentors/search-mentor)
The Mentoring Club is a great community of mentors volunteering their time to coach and mentor people. Product and data experts from there have helped me sanity check ideas and fill in gaps.


At first it's good to start with a short intro message which you can send on calendly if they are available there otherwise just connecting with people on linkedin and messaging them can work.


For the intro I recommend:
1. Objective
2. Intro
3. Next step

#### OBJECTIVE
I came across your profile on mentor club and would love to learn more about how to effectively apply A/B testing from you.


#### INTRO
Bit of background about me:
I cofounded Comtura to breakdown sales data silos and help people sell better conencting transcriptions to the CRM. I am in charge of all things data and machine learning at Comtura, I have 5 years experience in NLP.


#### NEXT STEP
If you had any time next week to chat that would be much appreciated.


The great thing about mentor's club is you get to see people's expertise and interests right away so you can find great matches fast.
The mentors  subreddit is another useful resource, for the last 6 month an ex technical manager from Black Swan data has been helping me understand where are my management gaps from there. Though the quality is a lot more hit and miss [Mentor subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/mentors/)
