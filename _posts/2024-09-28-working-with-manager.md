### 🎸 Rocking Performance Reviews

### 🪜 Climbing the Career Ladder

- Can we look at what I need to do for the next level?
- What should I focus on?

### 💪 Know What Your Manager is Great At

- Seeing business issues

- Making products
- Solving big tech issues

  Not every manager is good at everything, use their strengths

### 🦾 Build your Support Network

- There will always be things your manager can't help with
- Find a group of people with different skills who you can count on
  - Know what you need help with before asking, use your group's and manager time well!
  - Focus on fixing issues, not complaining!
