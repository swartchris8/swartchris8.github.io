In the first lesson we went through a bird or not a bird classifier, course overview, and walked through some of the features of the jupyter notebooks.

**Homework: tweak the bird or not bird classifier to create your own project or take inspiration from chapter 1 of the book which is available on gradio. You can start from the pet classifier in the book the text before that is not super useful.**

[To setup Paperspace gradio notebook environment](https://useml.net/posts/2022/09/27/nurnberg-ml-course-setup-guide.html)

The [fastai documentation](https://docs.fast.ai/) is an excellent place to start to see how different parts of fastai works 

Download the code from [Bird or not bird Kaggle notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/jhoward/is-it-a-bird-creating-a-model-from-your-own-data/) and upload it to paperspace to create your own model 

**If you have limited time please focus on tweaking the model for your own application.**
