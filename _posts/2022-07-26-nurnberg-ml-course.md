Practical Deep Learning for Coders -- Nürnberg + Zoom -- Part 1

- Course is free and open to anyone!
- Requires Python knowledge
- Time commitment -- 90 minutes a week -- 8 weeks

###  Course structure

This course will follow [Fastai's 2022 edition of Practical Deep Learning for Coders](https://course.fast.ai/). The course follows a top down project first approach to teaching and applying machine learning concepts. By the end of the course you will have your very own machine learning project applied to an area of interest to you

Basic Python knowledge is a requirement for this course. If you are interested in learning basic Python concepts there are many online resources such as [Free Code Camp](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfscVS0vtbw) that can help learn Python.

I will be following the Fastai syllabus, explaining the concepts coming up in the lessons myself, and helping you with your project to make sure you build something. I will try my best to empower you to build a project. 

The course requires a biweekly commitment of 90 minutes. In the first lesson I will explain how the interactive course environment, Jupyter Notebooks. You don’t need prior experience with Jupyter Notebooks. This environment will allow you to tweak the materials you are studying and apply them to your own domain.

### My [background in machine learning](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christiaan-swart-51a68967/)

I have spent 6 years working in Natural Language Processing (NLP) across pharma, complaints, and other sectors. For the last 1.5 year I have been working on my own startup [Comtura](https://comtura.ai/), where I lead machine learning. Comtura is on a mission to help sales teams sell more by using your customer's voice in your sales processes. I have also spent a year in the past developing a crop disease detection system using deep learning computer vision systems though my main expertise is NLP. I used to run an intro to NLP course in London pre-pandemic and really enjoy empowering people to build ML solutions.
