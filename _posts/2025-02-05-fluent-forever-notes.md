# Fluent Forever - Chapter 1 Notes

Why do I want to learn German?
I want to be able to: operate in Germany without barriers, and consume German culture

Why do I want to learn Turkish?
I want to be able to communicate with Dilek in her mother tongue and talk with her family.

## Core Concept
- Language learning is like a sport (fencing metaphor)

- Key insight: No language is inherently "hard" - any child can learn their parents' language

## Core Tasks
1. Learn Pronunciation First (from classical singing/Mormon missionary approach)
2. Don't Translate - Learn to Think in Target Language
3. Use Spaced Repetition Systems (SRS) for Modern Memory Enhancement

## Time Investment & Expectations
- Basic Timeline (for English speakers learning French/Level 1 languages):
  - 3 months: Basic conversational level (1 hour/day + weekend study)
  - 7-8 weeks intensive immersion: Advanced level
- Difficulty Multipliers:
  - Level 2 languages (Russian, Hebrew): 2x longer
  - Level 3 languages (Chinese, Arabic, Japanese, Korean): 4x longer
- Daily Commitment: 30-45 minutes/day minimum
- Goals: Comfortable in cafes, casual chatting, basic life situations
