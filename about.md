I am Chris Swart, I have more than 7 years experience building Natural Language Processing products and services. I enjoy a full stack machine learning perspective taking ideas from the drawing board, through data augmentation and model tuning, to deploying APIs to serve models. I have worked across a number of different sectors from complaints, biotech, to sales tech currently.

I am currently working on building products on top of LLMs.

I enjoy public speaking about machine learning and have spoken at:

- Crunch Conference 2022 -- Workshop on Weak supervision a force multiplier in dataset creation
- DataTalks.club 2022 - [Dataset Creation and Curation podcast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QggWydGrWoo)
- Apache Beam Europe 2019 - [Large scale Natural Language Processing of biomedical literature](https://youtu.be/7GwXJJApPtg)
- Minds Mastering Machines 2018 - [Clustering and classification: when to use which technique?](https://youtu.be/erwGrz9JvX8)

Outside of work I enjoy improv theatre, swimming, and cooking.
